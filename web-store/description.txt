Clash of LLMs puts AI chatbots head-to-head in real-time, side by side.

Pick any two AI chatbots — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, or Perplexity — choose how they should interact, and watch them go.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Pick your fighters: Choose which two AI chatbots to pit against each other
2. Choose a mode: Debate, roast battle, interview, collaborative writing, and more
3. Set the vibe: Add optional personalities (Pirate, Shakespeare, Drill Sergeant...) and a setting
4. Watch it unfold: The AIs take turns responding in real-time
5. Export the transcript: Save the full exchange as a PDF
